My personal project to download and watch YouTube videos in both audio and video formates. 

This app was written according to MVVM-C + RxSwift pattern, for downloading videos from YouTube I used YoutubeKit, for fetching video info I used XCDYouTubeKit.  

This app has a lot features that need to be added later, such as downloading only audio format. Now app allows user to download videos from YouTube and listen it as music with music player and remote center commands and if user wants he can watch it as video ( still in development, so remote command center might brake everytime you watvh video ).
