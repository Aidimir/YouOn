My personal project to download and watch YouTube videos in both audio and video formates. 

This app was written according to MVVM-C + RxSwift pattern, for downloading videos from YouTube I used YoutubeKit, for fetching video info I used XCDYouTubeKit.  

This app has a lot of features that are worth adding in the future, such as downloading only audio format, add custom videoPlayer, remake finder page, add search by video title, etc. Now The application allows the user to download videos from Youtube and listen to it in both audio and video format (video playback is still in development).

If someone wants to join/modify my project, I will be glad to receive your pull request.
